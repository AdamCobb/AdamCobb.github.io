### Background

My undergraduate master's was in Engineering Science at the University of Oxford. On the course I covered aspects of Information, Electrical, Civil, Mechanical and Chemical Engineering, finally ending up specialising in Information Engineering. My thesis focussed on detecting exoplanets _(planets around other stars)_ in the Kepler Mission data consisting of three and a half years of observations.


### Academic Interests

* Machine Learning applications
* Gaussian processes
* Reinforcement Learning (and Inverse Reinforcement Learning)
* Multi-Agent Systems
* Deep Learning

### Interests

Outside my academic work I have a variety of interests and hobbies that I pursue. As an avid Chelsea fan, it is no surprise that my favourite sport is football, which I enjoy playing and watching. I also enjoy running, swimming, golf and tennis. I am a keen traveller and have had the fortune to visit some very interesting places and hope to continue this trend as much as possible. It is also a hobby of mine to keep up to date with the space industry and to make sure I am following current affairs. I also enjoy learning languages and am currently trying to learn Mandarin, having already reached a good level in German and an acceptable level in French _(although a little rusty)_.
